ASCII Art Logo: Displays a cybersecurity awareness message.
Interactive Chat: Allows users to ask cybersecurity-related questions and receive informative responses.
Exit Mechanism: Users can type exit or quit to end the conversation.
Enter your name when prompted.
Ask cybersecurity-related questions like:
"How are you?"
"What is phishing?"
"Tell me about password safety."

but if the voice file is missing, an error message will be displayed, but the chatbot will continue running.
If an empty input is provided, the chatbot will prompt the user to ask a valid question.
